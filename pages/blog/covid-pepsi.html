            <p>Anyway, i've been off work for almost a full week, and Monday through Thursday it was pretty bad but today on friday its getting better.</p>
            <p>Last night i went to drink a pepsi, and i was destoryed</p>

            <p class="angry-text">A rouge Gamma beam fled the suns gravity dodging asteroids, comets and space dust entering the atmosphere and clocking me straight in the jaw.</p>
            <p class="angry-text">A car on the freeway going 120 MPH had one of its wheels fly off and continue spinning until it reached my house, punctured the gas line, then got stuck in a ditch, spinning fast without stop creating enough friction to start a small fire igniting the infinite source of gas and exploding my house.</p>
